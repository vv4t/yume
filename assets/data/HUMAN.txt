HUMAN: Hello.

PLAYER: Hello. I am an ambassador for a distant people here to
establish peaceful relations. Do your people govern this structure?

HUMAN: In a way? I am part of a group of nomads that roam this structure.

PLAYER: How do I reach the administration?

HUMAN: I'm not quite sure what you mean, but ahead of here, there is an elevator which goes down.

HUMAN: Take it down to 4532 levels. Neither I nor my group have been down there but they say the city's creators dwell below.

PLAYER: Thank you.
