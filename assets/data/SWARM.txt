***WORK IN PROGRESS***

AMALGAMATE: I welcome you to the city, traveller.

PLAYER: Thank you.

AMALGMATE: You understand me. It seems you have already learnt our language. I
congratulate you. It is a wonderful surprise that someone has been able to make
use of my stone.

PLAYER: Were you the one that carved the stone?

AMALGAMATE: I've been awoken by many travllers. It took a few to learn some
common passerby languages. It took many more to learn of their language
schemas. And many, many more to inscribe our own language onto one.

AMALGAMATE: But it was worth the effort. What misery it is, waking up to
someone I can't talk with. Please, tell me about yourself.

PLAYER: As you have already gathered, I am a traveller, an ambassador for a
distant peoples. This structure, it announces its presence quite loudly. I
have come for my people to investigate. Please, tell who you are and about this
place.

AMALGAMATE: I remember when the starry sky would also stay still from moment to
moment. Now, every time as I awaken, they seem to have ran off to some
different spot. The only thing still here as always, the slow dull drones of
the net.
