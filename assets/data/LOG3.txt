-- BEGIN LOG --

I have encountered my first sentient structure on this structure.
The creature was of a biological nature and was initially a disjoint swarm of creatuers.
However, when it eventually amalgamated in front of me.
The creature has told me a great deal about this place, but it does not seem to be any governing position.
