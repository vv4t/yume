** ENTRANCE
as the player walks around, there are swarms of small creature
when the player is about to step onto the stairs, the swarm assembles into an
"amalgamate", blocking the player

AMALGAMATE:
  I welcome you to the city, traveller.

PLAYER:
  Thank you.

AMALGMATE:
  You understand me. It seems you have already learnt our language. I
  congratulate you. It is a wonderful surprise that someone has been able to
  make use of my stone.

PLAYER:
  Were you the one that carved the stone?

AMALGAMATE:
  I've been awoken by many travllers. It took a few to learn some common
  passerby languages. It took many more to learn of their language schemas. And
  many, many more to inscribe our own language onto one.

AMALGAMATE:
  But it was worth the effort. What misery it is, waking up to someone I can't
  talk with. Please, tell me about yourself.

PLAYER:
  As you have already gathered, I am a travller, an ambassador for a distant
  peoples. This structure, its announces its presence quite loudly. I have come
  for my people to investigate. Please, tell who you are and about this place.

AMALGAMATE:
  

AMALGAMATE:
  I remember when the starry sky would also stay still from moment to moment.
  Now, every time as I awaken, they seem to have ran off to some different spot.
  The only thing still here as always, the slow dull drones of the net.

PLAYER:
  Your stone? Were you the one that carved the language relief?

PLAYER:
